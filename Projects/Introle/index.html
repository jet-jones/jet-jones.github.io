<h2><em>A short puzzle game about moving things.</em></h2>
<p>You play as a lever that can take control of platforms to slide them around in 16 different levels.</p>
<p>
Introle is a small puzzle game I developed over several months using gamemaker. 
I challenged myself to make a 3d game inside an engine which usually only supports 2d. Because of this I had to develop my own tools and pipeline for editing levels, loading art assets and rendering effects such as reflections.
You can download the game <a href="https://jet-j.itch.io/introle">here</a>
