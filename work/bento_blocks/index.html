    <h1>Development Notes</h1>

    <h2>Early Prototype</h2>

        <p>
          Development of a prototype started in early july of 2023, initially I was thinking about
          a game where you cut big sheets of wood into sections to build furniture. I think that
          would have required 3d to work though and I really wanted to work on something simple.
          So instead
          wood block puzzles where you have to fit all the pieces in a box
          which I guess is basically tetris.

    <h2>Back from the dead?</h2>

    <p>
      In june of 2024 Andy, Sofia and I were looking for a new project to work on that we could actually finish a
      polished version of.

      The initial version of the game took less than a week to get working, with the experience from the previous
      prototype and
      enthusiam to get past the initial ideas into something that was actually finished.
      with a new cooking theme.

    <h2>Playtesting</h2>

    <p>Proved that the foundations were solid, </p>
    <img src="images/mds_showcase.webp">
    <p>Showing at gdc was supposed to be a test of the game on a more general audience
      while that wasn't exactly
      we still learnt alot about the types of platforms
