<h2>Development</h2>

<!--
<p>
Introle is a small puzzle game I developed over several months using gamemaker.
</p>

<div style="display: flex;">
    <p>
        Development started as a small unity prototype exploring some technical features like 
        terrain generation and non voxel grids, aswell as tiles that were a much larger scale
        then other voxel games like Minecraft so even one block inclines 
        would be a challenge and require stairs or a ladder to climb. One of the first things 
        I implemented was an enemy that could move between tiles on the grid,
        I'd been playing a lot of <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/">puzzle script</a> 
        and sokoban like games at the time 
        so I guess I was thinking a lot about entities moving on the grid. 
        I made a few concept renders more to get the tone and style, and moved into development of the 
        first playable version.

        <h3> <a href="proposal.pdf">Proposal</a></h3>
        <p>
            I'm not really a big fan of proposal / design documents because I think it trys to lock 
            in to many things at the start like scope, artstyle etc but it was required for the 
            class

<p>
    I think one of the largest flaws in the game was adding the ability for modules to stick together
    at the time it was an easy way to create "tricky" levels.

    But if I had been a more experienced designer I would have realized that it 
    undermined what the game was trying to be about it's core.
    The interplay between the large grid entities and how they shape the path of the player on the ground.

<p>
    Became less about scale inbalance, and more about a contrast between tile based gameplay 
    and free moving

<h3>Postmortem</h3>


<p>
    I think it would be easy to say that this project got bogged down a lot with technical stuff,
    which held back the design from reaching a nice conclusion. While the 3d stuff 
    certainly didn't help I think if I broke down the hours on the project 
    it wouldn't be  
    there were other factors in the way


    so it became more about these interconnected rooms which was theoretically cool

    Certainly taught me a lot about finishing projects
