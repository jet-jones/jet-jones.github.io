    This project recreates a detailed environment inspired by the Crystal Palace and similar gardens of the 1950s, focusing on their unique mix of architecture and nature. Drawing from historical references and design styles of the time, the goal was to bring these spaces to life in a way that feels both authentic and inviting.
<br><br>

    The environment emphasizes the beauty of glass, steel, and greenery working together, using Unreal Engine 5 to create realistic lighting, textures, and atmosphere. The design choices were informed by research into the period, from the architectural details to the layout of the gardens, aiming to capture the sense of wonder these spaces inspired.
<br><br>
A significant portion of the project’s development time was spent attempting to recreate the intricate cast iron detailing that defines the architecture of the Crystal Palace. These delicate, ornamental patterns are central to its identity, and I explored various approaches—from detailed modeling to optimized texture workflows—to capture their complexity. However, the precision required proved far more time-consuming than anticipated, which had a knock-on effect on the rest of the environment. Areas like foliage density, texturing, and lighting adjustments didn’t receive the attention they needed due to the focus on these details.
<br><br>
Through this process, I gained a deep appreciation for the craftsmanship involved in creating these structures. The fact that such elaborate designs were not only conceived but constructed within such short timelines in the 19th century is a testament to the skill and ingenuity of the artisans and engineers of the time. This challenge gave me a renewed respect for their work and highlighted the immense effort behind these historic spaces.
