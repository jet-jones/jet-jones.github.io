I’d made a system a while ago for doing 3d tile-based games in unreal but never ended 
up using it for anything, I had also realized that I could make levels quickly with the 
cube grid modelling tools that I had enjoyed using last time if I found a way to convert 
them to tiles. Since the brief was so open, forcing it to be something tile based helped to 
restrict the prototyping phase. I started with some early experimentation with moving 
around very large tiles, but this was too similar to another game I’d made.  
Eventually the prototypes developed 
into more of a Spelunky type thing, 
where there’s a bunch of objects with 
unique properties and you use items 
on the objects in different ways to get 
coins and complete the level. I tried a 
bunch of different stuff here but was 
struggling to make the interactions 
interesting without very specific 
setups. I think it’s just because I 
wasn’t particularly used to this type 
of design, randomizing the levels 
earlier on might have helped to have interesting combinations arising naturally rather 
than hand placing everything. I would still like to try a game like this at some point, but 
it was already halfway through the term, so I decided to switch to something I was more 
familiar with. 
One of the item types I developed for the Spelunky prototype was a fungus that would 
slowly grow to fill the space, I then made more versions of the same object that grew in 
lines, or a flat plane and I was finding it fun 
to just move around on these dynamic 
structures that you could place anywhere. So, 
I took the plants into a new project and got 
rid of everything else except the inventory 
system and started trying to make interesting 
obstacle courses to navigate around   
This soon turned into more puzzly kinds of 
levels where you must combine 2 or 3 plants 
in a more specific configuration to get across 
a gap. A lot of the first ones I found were 
quite complicated but eventually I had a set 
of 15ish pretty fun levels with a nice range of 
difficulties.  
I then started to combine them into a shared 
open environment which introduced a bunch 
of challenges, primarily ensuring that the 
player couldn’t easily cheat their way out of 
the level by stacking plants on top of other 
plants. At first, I tried a decay system where 
plants would eventually disappear after a few 
seconds, but it added unnecessary timing to 
the challenges and the seeds had to be on a 
timer as well. It also required things to be 
spread out more so that you couldn’t grab 
plants from one section and use them in 
other while the placed plants were still 
decaying. After several other ideas, I decided 
on the inventory approach. I’m still not 
entirely happy with it but it was the least bad 
option.
