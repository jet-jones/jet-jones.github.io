                I’d made a system a while ago for doing 3d tile-based games in unreal but never ended 
                up using it for anything, since the brief was so open forcing it to be something tile based helped to 
                restrict the prototyping phase. I started with some early experimentation with moving 
                around very large tiles, but this was too similar to another game I’d made.  
                Eventually the prototypes developed into more of a Spelunky type thing, 
                where there’s a bunch of objects with unique properties and you use items 
                on the objects in different ways to get coins and complete the level. I tried a 
                bunch of different stuff here but was struggling to make the interactions 
                interesting without very specific setups. I think it’s just because I 
                wasn’t particularly used to this type of design, randomizing the levels 
                earlier on might have helped to have interesting combinations arising naturally rather 
                than hand placing everything. I would still like to try a game like this at some point, but 
                it was already halfway through the time alloted for the game, so I decided to switch to something I was more
                familiar with.
            </p>

                One of the item types I developed for the Spelunky prototype was a fungus that would 
                slowly grow to fill the space, I then made more versions of the same object that grew in 
                lines, or a flat plane and I was finding it fun to just move around on these dynamic 
                structures that you could place anywhere. So, I took the plants into a new project and got 
                rid of everything else except the inventory system and started trying to make interesting 
                obstacle courses to navigate around This soon turned into more puzzly kinds of 
                levels where you must combine 2 or 3 plants in a more specific configuration to get across 
                a gap. A lot of the first ones I found were quite complicated but eventually I had a set 
                of 15ish pretty fun levels with a nice range of difficulties. I then started to combine them into a shared 
                open environment which introduced a bunch of challenges, primarily ensuring that the 
                player couldn’t easily cheat their way out of the level by stacking plants on top of other 
                plants. At first, I tried a decay system where plants would eventually disappear after a few 
                seconds, but it added unnecessary timing to the challenges and the seeds had to be on a 
                timer as well. It also required things to be spread out more so that you couldn’t grab 
                plants from one section and use them in other while the placed plants were still 
                decaying. After several other ideas, I decided on the inventory approach. I’m still not 
                entirely happy with it but it was the least bad option.

                Overall this project taught me a lot about trying to have multiple distinct puzzles in the same game space,
                and why it's not really worth it if that's not going to be the focus of the game. If I were to expand this game
                or doing something similar one of the first things I would want to put in, is someway of visualizing what areas
                are accessible from where the player is standing this would have avoided many of the errors that ended up in the 
                prototype.

    <h1>Water's Edge</h1>
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; justify-content: center;">
        <div>
        <p >
            Simple prototype of a game where you can 
        control the height of water with the mouse wheel.
        The first level introduces the mechanic and 
        how it interacts with buttons and crates, 
        aswell as standing on things to float. The 
        second level expands the mechanic with two 
        different bodies of water that can be controlled independently, 
        the third shows crates stacked on top of each other and the fourth is 
        about more complicated interactions. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The core idea is solid, and expanding to support multiple areas of water was a good
            way to increase the ceiling for complexity a lot without introducing more arbitrary systems.

            Just difficult to communicate where buttons are 
            maybe this is something that would work better in 2d.

            Made for a 48 hour game jam in 2023, the theme was roots.
            Probably more happy with it aesthetically, in the way it clearly communicates the rules through simple shapes. 
            But the gameplay was too unfocused to be interesting, the branching thing is just sort of added on to another game 
            about the topology of objects.
