					<h1>Points</h1>

					<img src="slideshow_images/stippling.webp" width="40%">
					<img src="slideshow_images/vstippling.png" width="60%">
					<aside class="notes">
						The first thing I thought of was some kind of stippled / dithering algorithm, 
						you could bias point density more toward the crevice and highlights and less on big flat surfaces.
						and it still looks pretty good even at low densities

				<section>
					<img src="slideshow_images/ao_diagram.png" width="40%">
					<h1>Sampling per decal</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						But one of the things I was sort of stuck on at the start was that each point would sample
						it's own lighting value,  
						and it seemed kind of weird to me have a seperate process baking an ao map that determined the
						position but then also each point would be rendering their own lighting values. 
						I wanted something simpler to begin with so I just decided to start with a good even 
						sampling of the surface
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<img src="slideshow_images/bunny_samples1.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						The most obvious thing is just a random sampling, which isn't ideal. 
						Theres big clusters of points and gaps where it feels like there should be more points
						not very pleasing to look at.
					</aside>
					<h1>Random</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="slideshow_images/bunny_samples2.png">
					<h1>Blue Noise, Uniform, Gaussian, Poisson Etc</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						but this is an art program so we want something that actually looks good.
						this is blue noise or uniform distribution or gaussian even though its not really gaussian
						but compared to the random these points evenly cover the space
						no points are too close together, or too far apart

					<h1>Dart throwing</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						So obviously we want this nice distribution and 
						one of the easiest way to go about generating this is just to pick a random point
						and if it's too close to any existing points remove it then repeat.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="slideshow_images/dart_throwing_performance.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						But this can become kind of slow because as points are added it becomes less and less likely that a 
						new point is going to spawn in an empty spot. To achieve complete coverage of an area the algorithm reaches
						a point where it's doing thousands of tests just to find a single empty spot.
						and it can be hard to determine when this process is finished. 
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="slideshow_images/poisson-disc-sampling.gif" width="650px">
					<h1>Disk Sampling</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						Disk sampling is similar but instead of picking a random position you pick points in a radius 
						around existing points, in this sort of growing wavefront
						and the advantage of this is that it will grow at a consistent speed until the space is completly
						filled.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="slideshow_images/slow_poisson.webp">
					<aside class="notes"> 
						And that's what that looks like in the tool 
						It's not bad but at higher densities you can definitly watch it grow as the density is changed 
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="images/poisson_demo.webp">
					<aside class="notes">
						So what I've ended up with is a combination of both
						
						theres absolutely work I could do in optimizing my spatial acceleration structures but
						far more usable.

					<aside class="notes">
						Can't pregenerate because the density needs to be variable, 

						rethrowing just 
						
						I like algorithms for this that iteratively approach a final result

						Could possibly split it into multiple chunks and run on seperate threads and then do a merge pass 
						but then when would the merging be done after the chunks are finished?

					<h1>Even More Ideas</h1>
						<!--<img src="slideshow_images/buckets.gif" height="400px">-->
						<img src="slideshow_images/lloyds_relaxation.webp" height=400px>
					<aside class="notes">
						In researching this I found Lloyd's relaxation which might actually be way nicer, 
						it can start with a bunch of random points and then iteratively push them towards being more 
						evenly spaced with some delaunay rules 

						one of the things I like about the current method is that you can immediatly start rendering samples
						as soon as a point is placed. But if your moving the points around that data would be incorrect. 

						I think eventually 
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>

					<img src="images/poisson_demo.webp">
					<aside class="notes">
						My general point with this is ideally everything would update instantly,
						on the same frame it was changed so that you could see the results exactly.

						But theres always going to be situtations where that's not practical
						especially when your allowing users to add as many objects as they want 

						so if that's 

						then you need to take into consideration how your algorithm looks as it develops 
						especially if it's the core of a program.

						The worst thing is to have a delay before anything shows up on screen.

						But even if your showing something theres still a broad range of 

						
						I prefer something that iteratively approaches a final result rather than something that

						it's more important that you can approximate the final placement as quickly as possible
						I would vastly prefer this over something else
						even if this took longer
						I'm always gonna vastly prefer something like this even if it were takes longer to reach full coverage

<!-- GAME DESIGN ? -->
<!--
				<section>
					<h1>Open Design</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						Another thing I was surprised by was just how many parralels I found between 
						the thinking involved in software design and games
						I guess it shouldn't be all that surprising but 

						For example
						One of my favourite ideas from game design is this idea of coverage of the space,
						meaning like you've set the boundaries of what your game or tool or ___ can do and 
						everything should have some interaction with everything else
						even if not particularly useful or the result is weird
					</aside>

				<section>
					<img src="images/evolution_2.webp" width="60%">
					<aside class="notes">
						So to give a more real example since that was probably a little abstract, 
						early on the controls looked like this.

				<section>
					<h1> Maximal expressiveness from the most minimal set of controls.</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						So in some way 
						Like in games where your searching for 
					
						I guess in some sense you can determine the beauty of your software by 
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<aside class="notes">
						Early on I was like oh I'll add a different type of map that is direction values and then you can paint
						like a flow map and then that will determine the orientation of the decals. 

						But then it's like

						it's your job to still cover that part of the design space
						or otherwise it can feel incomplete

						Often it costs nothing or very little to be more open with how it operates
						and I guess the counter argument to all this would be well your adding extra options that don't really make sense

<!-- BONUS TECHNICAL -->
				<section>
					<h1>More stuff</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						Heres a bunch of, mostly technical stuff that would have saved me time had I known it before

				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h1>Debugging pixels</h1>
					<img src="slideshow_images/texture_viewer.webp" width="60%">
					<aside class="notes">
						Towards the end of the initial prototype I put in proper controls for the texture viewport just 
						because I thought it would be nice to have when painting but it actually ended up being super useful
						for debugging aswell especially so after I added a little overlay to show the value of the hovered pixel 
						which isn't show in the gif.
						it would have saved me so much time when intitially working on the ao generation stuff to inspect weird 
						1 pixel seams or ensure values are in a specific range. 
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Debugging pixels</h1>
					<img src="slideshow_images/pixel_debugger.webp" width="70%">
					<aside class="notes">
						But actually recently I found this which is the bitmap view rule in the raddebugger which lets you specify 
						a size and pixel format for a variable and then it'll go and render a preview that updates as i 
						step through. So i've almost completley switched to using this for things
						I still haven't worked out a way to see the specific values for each pixel but I'm sure theres a way 
						of turning that on aswell
					</aside>

				<section>
					<img src="slideshow_images/density_sideeffect.gif">
					<aside class="notes">
						As the density is changed, rotation is also affected like those points in the middle are 
						clearly in the same spot visually and yet 
					
						And this happens because I implemented it in the simplest way where
						I reset all the points any time the density is modified, 
					
						I actually inadvertenly solved this by making the rotation but you could imagine 
						some more complicated system

						It's like 40 lines at most just copy it in and move on 
						there's more advanced shit for sure, if you really want to get into it
						but at minimum if your making a creative software with gradients
						you have no excuse to not atleast support hsv and some perceptual color space other than srgb.

						Another thing that helped me to make color stuff even easier was being strict about color spaces

						While this didn't neccesarily save me much time on this project, 
						it certainly got me thinking much more about

					<h1>Decal rendering open question</h1>
					<img src="slideshow_images/ugly_decal_rendering.PNG" width="80%">
					<aside class="notes">
						The uv seams are still clearly visible and thats 
						So here's my open question to end it on, I'm not really sure how to render the decals.
						In this type of software currently I'm just drawing a bunch of quad instances in a seperate 
						pass onto a render target that is then used to texture the mesh

					<h1>Deferred?</h1>
					<img src="https://mtnphil.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/box.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						Sometype of deferred screenspace solution wether in a
						fully deferred or forward+ pipeline
						but either way the problem 
						it's not an accurate representation of what the final texture will look Like.
						it will look better than it should

				<section>
					<h1>Classic Decals</h1>	

					<div style="display:flex; align-items: center; align-content: center;">
						<img src="https://cdn.wolfire.com/blog/decalgeom/decaltrianglescrop.jpg" width="50%">
						<img src="https://cdn.wolfire.com/blog/decalgeom/decalcheckerboard.jpg" width="45%">
					</div>

					<p>http://blog.wolfire.com/2009/06/how-to-project-decals/</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Where you generate a set of triangles, by clipping the mesh from a viewpoint and then using the triangles and uvs from 
						that viewpoint to render a mesh with the decal texture.
						and this would actually work because I assume you could just take the calculated triangles and convert 
						them back to the uv space of the original mesh but doing this for 100k+ decals that I would ideally like to be 
						able to modify each frame seems like pushing it, maybe this wouldn't be as big of an issue if they were often only 
						clipping a single triangle but it still feels like there has to be a more direct way.

					<h1>Other techniques</h1>

					<p>https://www.inf.usi.ch/hormann/papers/Scharfig.2010.HA3.pdf</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						So I went looking,
						Which might be the right direction however
						and I could definitly be reading it wrong, 
						but often only seem to handle cases where your projecting one texture at at a time
						which obviously wouldn't work if you had to loop through and do that same process 100 thousand times.
